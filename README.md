# UFOs

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
We built a webpage for our client, Dana. The webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we had to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.


## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.



Our webpage has 5 input boxes that will allow a user to filter the UFO data.  

The first input box is date. If the user inputs a date, for example 1/1/2010, in the search box, the data displayed will be filtered. The result would output every dataset entered on 1/10/2010.


The second input box is city, so if the user inputs “bonita” in the search box, all data from the city bonita will be returned. 


State, the third user input box, also returns all the data from the state entered by the user. California “ca”, is entered in the example.



The fourth user box, country, will output data from the country entered. In this example it’s “us”.


The last user input box, is shape.

After the user hits enter, the following filtered table is returned:

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

I don’t love the way the Filter Search object looks. The upper part of the website looks professional and aesthetically pleasing, the search filter box looks a bit weird and the titles above the search boxes are very hard to read.
